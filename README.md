## No Merge

This is a simple extension which disables the green merge button for pull requests on GitHub. It is not perfect, but it gets the job done.


## Why?

Simply put, merge commits are bad. Keep your commit logs clean. Use rebase instead. There's a thread you can read [here](https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/5).


## Installation

Get it from the Google Chrome webstore [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/no-merge/ekbddbnbehcejcmagbccgamboklhdmdn).


## Developing

In order to test this in your local, follow the steps below:

1. Open a new tab on your Chrome, then navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Make sure you have enabled `Developer mode` if you haven't already.
3. Click on `Load unpacked extension...` button and point it to the root of the project.
4. Done.
5. To package it into an installable file, just click on `Pack extension...` and point to the root again.


## Creating your own

This Chrome extension was created with the help of [extensionizr](https://github.com/altryne/extensionizr). It's super easy to get started! Kudos to them!
