## No Merge

This is a simple extension which disables the green merge button for pull requests on GitHub. It is not perfect, but it gets the job done.


## Why?

Simply put, merge commits are bad. Keep your commit logs clean. Use rebase instead. There's a thread you can read [here](https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/5).


## Installation
Get it from the Google Chrome webstore [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/no-merge/ekbddbnbehcejcmagbccgamboklhdmdn).
